Honey Do List
This was meant to be a simple add and remove application in which I covered in the basic 
functions of the list. A user can add tasks to the list and remove them upon
completion. Mostly I was trying my hand in more javascript and CSS design and focused less
on the functionality. I will be updating this as time goes on.

Starting I had the 3 basic files; HTML, CSS, Javascript. Then I implemented it into a core
language, Ruby as the platform.

The System Dependencies include:
  coffee-rails (~> 4.0.0)
  jbuilder (~> 1.2)
  jquery-rails
  rails (= 4.0.0)
  sass-rails (~> 4.0.0)
  sdoc
  sqlite3
  turbolinks
  uglifier (>= 1.3.0)

Database I used at the time was Sqlite3.
